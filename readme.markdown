PrettyADN.pl
---------------

The extension.  Simply load it by adding -exts="/path/to/PrettyADN.pl" to your
ttytter invocation.

*Please note*: your terminal needs to support unicode and be at least 145
characters wide

Known Bugs
----------

This extension inexplicably breaks growl support (possibly other notifications
as well) - this may not still apply ( 2013-05-12 )

NOTE
----

I have not tested this code with anything but my own setup.  If you *do* run it
and encounter problems, I'd love to hear about it.

^ Applies to me too :D

TODO
----

Fix color support.
