PrettyADN.pl
---------------

The extension.  Simply load it by adding -exts="/path/to/PrettyADN.pl" to your
ttytter invocation. You can also add the `exts=` to your texapprc file to 
automatically load it.

*Please note*: your terminal needs to support unicode and be at least 145
characters wide


Known Bugs
----------

None!

The original ttytter extension states that it broke Growl/notification support,
but this has not been tested with the texapp extension.


NOTE
----

Testing? We don't need no stinkin' testing!

It works for me. It should work for you. If something is broken, that's on you,
but let me know and I'll see if there's something I can figure out.


TODO
----

Fix color support.
